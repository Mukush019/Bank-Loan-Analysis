## Overview
Banks make the most profit when they lend money to borrowers who later pay it back with interest. In this case, Thera Bank has more depositors who are considered as liabilities customers. The number of customers who borrow is small, and Thera Bank seeks to expand its profit base by onboarding more loan businesses. The bank intends to explore ways to convert liability customers to asset customers(borrowers) while still retaining them as depositors.
